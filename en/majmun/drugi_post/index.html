Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion. It was settled that each candidate, man or woman (for it was possible to choose a female pope), should, for the sake of leaving the impression of his grimace fresh and complete, cover his face and remain concealed in the chapel until the moment of his appearance. In less than an instant, the chapel was crowded with competitors, upon whom the door was then closed.</p><p>Coppenole, from his post, ordered all, directed all, arranged all. During the uproar, the cardinal, no less abashed than Gringoire, had retired with all his suite, under the pretext of business and vespers, without the crowd which his arrival had so deeply stirred being in the least moved by his departure. Guillaume Rym was the only one who noticed his eminence’s discomfiture. The attention of the populace, like the sun, pursued its revolution; having set out from one end of the hall, and halted for a space in the middle, it had now reached the other end. The marble table, the brocaded gallery had each had their day; it was now the turn of the chapel of Louis XI. Henceforth, the field was open to all folly. There was no one there now, but the Flemings and the rabble.</p><p>The grimaces began. The first face which appeared at the aperture, with eyelids turned up to the reds, a mouth open like a maw, and a brow wrinkled like our hussar boots of the Empire, evoked such an inextinguishable peal of laughter that Homer would have taken all these louts for gods. Nevertheless, the grand hall was anything but Olympus, and Gringoire’s poor Jupiter knew it better than any one else. A second and third grimace followed, then another and another; and the laughter and transports of delight went on increasing. There was in this spectacle, a peculiar power of intoxication and fascination, of which it would be difficult to convey to the reader of our day and our salons any idea.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://pleksa.ga/>&copy; pleksin sajt 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials><a href=https://twitter.com/GoHugoIO target=_blank class="twitter ananke-social-link link-transition stackoverflow link dib z-999 pt3 pt0-l mr1" title="Twitter link" rel=noopener aria-label="follow on Twitter——Opens in a new window"><span class=icon><svg style="enable-background:new 0 0 67 67" viewBox="0 0 67 67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M37.167 22.283c-2.619.953-4.274 3.411-4.086 6.101l.063 1.038-1.048-.127c-3.813-.487-7.145-2.139-9.974-4.915l-1.383-1.377-.356 1.017c-.754 2.267-.272 4.661 1.299 6.271.838.89.649 1.017-.796.487-.503-.169-.943-.296-.985-.233-.146.149.356 2.076.754 2.839.545 1.06 1.655 2.097 2.871 2.712l1.027.487-1.215.021c-1.173.0-1.215.021-1.089.467.419 1.377 2.074 2.839 3.918 3.475l1.299.444-1.131.678c-1.676.976-3.646 1.526-5.616 1.568C19.775 43.256 19 43.341 19 43.405c0 .211 2.557 1.397 4.044 1.864 4.463 1.377 9.765.783 13.746-1.568 2.829-1.673 5.657-5 6.978-8.221.713-1.716 1.425-4.851 1.425-6.354.0-.975.063-1.102 1.236-2.267.692-.678 1.341-1.419 1.467-1.631.21-.403.188-.403-.88-.043-1.781.636-2.033.551-1.152-.402.649-.678 1.425-1.907 1.425-2.267.0-.063-.314.042-.671.233-.377.212-1.215.53-1.844.72l-1.131.361-1.027-.7c-.566-.381-1.361-.805-1.781-.932C39.766 21.902 38.131 21.944 37.167 22.283zM33 64C16.432 64 3 50.569 3 34S16.432 4 33 4s30 13.431 30 30S49.568 64 33 64z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd"/></svg></span><span class=new-window><svg height="8" style="enable-background:new 0 0 1000 1000" viewBox="0 0 1e3 1e3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M598 128h298v298h-86V274L392 692l-60-60 418-418H598v-86zM810 810V512h86v298c0 46-40 86-86 86H214c-48 0-86-40-86-86V214c0-46 38-86 86-86h298v86H214v596h596z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd"/></svg></span></a></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
